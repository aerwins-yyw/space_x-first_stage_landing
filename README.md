# Capstone Project for IBM Data Science Professional Certificate
by Albertus Erwin Susanto 阎余文

## Intro
The advancements in space technology have significantly transformed the commercial space industry, with companies like SpaceX leading the way in cost-effective space exploration. One of SpaceX’s key innovations is the reusability of the Falcon 9 first-stage booster, which dramatically reduces the cost of space missions. A typical Falcon 9 launch costs $62 million, whereas other space launch providers charge over $165 million per launch. The ability to successfully land and reuse the first-stage booster is a crucial factor in these cost savings.

This capstone project focuses on predicting the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. By developing a predictive model, we aim to assess the probability of a successful landing and explore its impact on launch costs. This information is particularly valuable for competing aerospace companies seeking to evaluate the feasibility of bidding against SpaceX for commercial satellite launches.

## Methodology
Collect data using SpaceX REST API and web scraping techniques
Wrangle data to create success/fail outcome variable
Explore data with data visualization techniques, considering the following factors: payload, launch site, flight number and yearly trend
Analyze the data with SQL, calculating the following statistics: total payload, payload range for successful launches, and total of successful and failed outcomes
Explore launch site success rates and proximity to geographical markers
Visualize the launch sites with the most success and successful payload ranges
Build Models to predict landing outcomes

## ML Models 
Classification models using logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree and K-nearest neighbor (KNN)
