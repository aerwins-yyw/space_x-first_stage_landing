The advancements in space technology have significantly transformed the commercial space industry, with companies like SpaceX leading the way in cost-effective space exploration. One of SpaceX’s key innovations is the reusability of the Falcon 9 first-stage booster, which dramatically reduces the cost of space missions. A typical Falcon 9 launch costs $62 million, whereas other space launch providers charge over $165 million per launch. The ability to successfully land and reuse the first-stage booster is a crucial factor in these cost savings.
This capstone project focuses on predicting the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. By developing a predictive model, we aim to assess the probability of a successful landing and explore its impact on launch costs. This information is particularly valuable for competing aerospace companies seeking to evaluate the feasibility of bidding against SpaceX for commercial satellite launches.
